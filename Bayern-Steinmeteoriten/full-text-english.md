#### "About the stone meteorites found in Bavaria."

Among the stone meteorites that have fallen and been located in Bavarian areas, there are quite a few whose chemical composition is known to us only from antiquated analyses, while still no chemical investigation has been undertaken on any of them up till the present moment. Moreover, since many of them lack an exhaustive survey, such as has been recently performed on types of rock by means of a thin section and microscope, it thus seemed to me sufficiently interesting to carry out such work and compile the results with the earlier findings. Through the special kindness of professor Dr. [Wolfgang Franz] von Kobell, the gentleman curator of the mineralogical state collection, I obtained the material needed for this purpose and I gladly use this opportunity to express my best thanks for his friendly assistance in my investigation. Several broad remarks, which are included in the conclusions, are sourced from other meteoritic stones that I have from time to time pulled into the circle of my study for comparison.

It turns out that there are just five known stone meteorites that have fallen in Bavaria. Among them is actually included a find which, due to the present territorial circumstances, no longer belongs to Bavaria but to Austria, namely that of Mauerkirchen. Because the municipality belonged to Bavaria at the time of the fall, it should at least seem warranted to a certain extent to list this stone here among the Bavarian ones.

These five stone meteorites are:

1) The stone from Mauerkirchen, now in the Austrian Innviertel, from the fall on November 20, 1768, at four hours past midday.

2) The stone from Eichstädt, which fell five kilometers from the town in the so-called Wittmes [forest] on February 19, 1785 at twelve o'clock midday.

3) The stone from Massing near Altötting in southern Bavaria from the fall on December 13, 1803 between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.

4) The stone from Schönenberg next to Burgau and Swabia, which fell on December 25, 1846 at two o'clock in the afternoon and
 
5) The stone from Krähenberg by Homburg in the Rhenish Pfalz from the fall on May 5, 1869 at six thirty in the evening.

I first came upon information of a sixth meteoritic rock in [Ludwig Wilhelm] Gilbert's _Annals of Physics_, 15th volume page 317, where it is cited that Gaspar Schott's _Physica curiosa_, 11th volume 19th chapter, reports: "here in our city of Herbipolis [Würzburg] is preserved in the temple of St. Jacobi across the bastion, in the monastery of the Scots,* chained to the temple column... it is hard and with an iron nature." Hence, it works out that it was presumably an iron meteorite. I put forward my inquiries about vestiges of this rock to the gentleman Professor Sandberger in Würzburg, who was nice enough to perform the most thorough search. The rock is missing. Owing to Sandberger's gracious communication, further information is given by Schnurrer in his _History of Epidemics_, volume two: "In the year 1103 (or 1104) a meteoritic rock fell in Würzburg, so big that four men were hardly able to carry the fourth part of it."

*) The Scotch Monasteries were established in 1140, 1803 saeculo 1819 part of the church was restored for worship, the choir in fact, the rest served as a military depot. The complete description and history of Wieland is in the archive of the _Historical Association of Lower Franconia and Aschaffenburg_ Vol. 16.

#### The Meteoritic Stone from Mauerkirchen

([Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-1.png) in the accompanying table)

A short booklet initially told about this fall: "News and Reports on some Rocks Dropped out of the Air on November 20, 1768 in Bavaria not far from Mauerkirchen" (Straubingen 1769). Referring to the same, Chladni shares in his chronological list of stone and iron masses which have fallen down with a firey meteor (Gilbert's _Annals of Physics_, 1803. Vol. 15. p. 316) that sundry ordinary folk near Mauerkirchen, who swore to it when questioned, stated that in the evening on the aforementioned day after four o'clock the skies noticeably darkened against the west and they heard an extraordinary roar and powerful bang in the air like thunder and with shooting fragments. Beneath this aerial turmoil a rock had fallen out of the air and, according to an authoritative visual inspection, made a pit in the ground two and a half schuh* deep. The stone doesn't even hold up to be a schuh in length, is six zoll wide, and weighs 38 bavarian pounds. It is made of matter so soft that one can crush it with the fingers, the color bluish mixed with some white flows or streamers, and also coated by a black crust.

*) 1 schuh = 29.75 centimeters, 1 zoll is around 2.62 centimeters, 12 linie = 1 zoll

Professor Imhof supplemented this account (_Bavarian Electoral Palatinate. Weekly Paper_. 1804. Section 4) with the following particulars: "The fallen rock was located the day after hearing the noise, on the so-called Schinperpoint in an oblique hole going inward two and a half schuh deep." Imhof identified the specific weight as 3.452 and described the grayish black, one-quarter linie [line (unit)] thick crust as giving sparks on steel, furthermore as constituent components:

1) reguline iron, which has fused with much of the exterior crust in little kernels and tines, is very pliable and viscous and makes a white, thick shiny filing streak,

2) pyrites,

3) small, flattened, angular grains, which are distinguished by their dark gray color, shell-like breaks, glistening appearance, and greater hardness,

4) still other tiny kernels of a white and yellow color that are translucent and shimmering. According to his analysis, the meteoritic stone is comprised of:

Silica 25.40  
Iron oxide 40.24  
Iron 2.33  
Nickel 1.20  
Magnesia 28.75  
Sulphur and losses 2.08  

(Compare with Otto Büchner's _Meteorites in Collections_ 1863 p. 9.)

Closer examination of the stone further revealed to me that the matt black, slightly glossy in spots, 0.7 — 0.3 mm. thick crust, like with other meteoritic stones, is merely fusion crust, which merges against the inner main mass without a sharp boundary because this is strenthened by the tiny iron pieces that border it, where sure enough faint amber granules are located and appear more glossy in the latter spots. Frequently the same small mineral pieces are melted and embedded in the crust or protrude into it. The main mass of the stone is colored light gray, dotted black due to the interspersed meteoritic iron, and, at many of these black spots, stained a rust color due to the effects of iron oxidation. The stone may easily be crushed between the fingers and has the impression of a trachytic tuff.

Out of the utterly fine, crumbly, almost dust-like matrix there arise quite a number of interspersed, roundish, poppy seed to millet sized granules, which are usually somewhat dark black or yellowish in color, matt on the exterior, and shiny like glass without cleavage surfaces when shattered, that have the character of chondrules and therefore imprint upon this stone the seal of the chondrites. Beneath the microscope these granules display a distinct quality. Some are very finely parallely striated, such that predominantly opaque, wide strips alternate with narrow, small transparent or translucent ones, as if transversely organized. In polarized light the latter show up with finely dappled matt colors. (_y_ in the illustration from the accompanying table, [Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-1.png)). Other granules are whitish, as if composed of the finest flour, opaque, but a little translucent around the edges, occasionally with the finest, slightly glimmering, separate, irregularly interspersed little needles (_x_ in the illustration).  Additionally, other granules have a type of radial fiber, though not clearly shown here. The smallest, rounded bits are water clear and show up in polarized light as brilliant motley colors.

Aside from the chondrules embedded in the powdery main mass, there are more numerous, usually short, angular, elongated little slivers of a whitened mineral, which are noticeably reflective at the cleavage surface and in places vaguely parallely striated, and more roundish, angular, unevenly cracked, seldomly parallely striped granules that are distinguished by a yellowish or brownish color tone and a glass-like luster. To these are added metallically glistening, relatively small, botryoidal, angular clumps of meteoritic iron, in addition to the uncommon brassy yellow sulphuric iron and the deep black, not metallically glistening, small chrome iron rods. On the worn off parts of the stone the harder granules stick out and allow the character of the chondrites to be clearly perceived, more so than with the transverse breaks, in which one notices the spherical deposits only with greater attention. The finest dust particles, which have to be considered as the agglutinating material resulting from the progressive granulation of the larger slivers, are partly water clear, partly opaque, translucent, and turn out to be even in the smallest detail little birefringent crystalline shards, although in polarized light the multicolored shades are matt. There is not a trace of a glass-like intermediate mass to be found.

After treating the finely crushed (not pulverized) material with saltpeter hydrochloric acid and potash solution — apart from the metallic constituent parts — the yellowish little slivers (olivine) have disappeared and the remains are only of white and brownish scraps, which can be easily distinguished under the microscope. The brownish fragments are heavily fissured, seldomly furnished with traces of tiny, dim parallel striations, transparent, and in polarized light colored vibrantly with motley colors. They are undoubtedly little pieces of a mineral from the augite group. The white little slivers, in contrast, are in many cases only translucent, partly corroded by the acids, and in polarized light speckled with matt color tones, which here and there remind one of a striped design. The chemical analysis of the portion leftover following the action of the acids is also evidence that these little slivers have to be interpreted as feldspar-like constituent parts. The tiniest black particles are to be regarded as chrome iron. Thus, the stone consists of olivine, a feldspar-like augitic mineral, and meteoritic sulphur and chrome iron.

So that the chemical analysis was correct as well, the gentleman assistant Adolf Schwager was separately supervising examinations conducted at the same time. The measurement of the meteoritic and sulphuric iron was done through individual experiments.* The analyses yielded:

*) Anything extractable was taken out of the crushed powder with the magnet and these component parts containing meteoritic iron were specially analyzed with the application of copper vitriol and copper chloride.

Compounds: | Bulk analysis 65.45% portion decomposable in hydrochloric acid | 34.55% remainder elemental parts

Silica | 38.14 | 23.23 | 61.39  
Aluminium oxide | 2.51 | 1.20 | 5.00  
Iron(II) oxide | 25.70 | 32.72 | 17.59  
Iron & Nickel | 6.30 | 9.65 | -. -  
Sulfur | 2.09 | 3.20 | -. -  
Phosphorus | 0.14 | 0.22 | -. -  
Chromium(II) oxide | 0.39 | -. - | 0.84  
Calcium oxide | 2.27 | 1.51 | 4.35  
Magnesium oxide | 21.73 | 29.13 | 7.70  
Potash | 0.48 | Traces | 1.40  
Natron | 1.00 | Traces | 2.91  
Sum | 100.75 | 100.86 | 101.18  

It therefore logically follows that the stone meteorite of Mauerkirchen tops the list of silica impoverished chondrites, like those of Seres, Buchhof [Buschhof], Ensisheim, and Château-Renard.

Meteoritic iron 2.81%  
Sulphuric iron 5.72  
Chrome iron 0.75  
Silicates 90.72
