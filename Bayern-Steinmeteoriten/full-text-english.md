#### "About the stone meteorites found in Bavaria."

Among the stone meteorites that have fallen and been located in Bavarian areas, there are quite a few whose chemical composition is known to us only from antiquated analyses, while still no chemical investigation has been undertaken on any of them up till the present moment. Moreover, since many of them lack an exhaustive survey, such as has been recently performed on types of rock by means of a thin section and microscope, it thus seemed to me sufficiently interesting to carry out such work and compare the results with the earlier findings. Through the special kindness of professor Dr. [Wolfgang Franz] von Kobell, the gentleman curator of the mineralogical state collection, I obtained the material needed for this purpose and I gladly use this opportunity to express my best thanks for his friendly assistance in my investigation. Several broad remarks, which are included in the conclusions, are sourced from other meteoritic stones that I have from time to time pulled into the circle of my study for comparison.

It turns out that there are just five known stone meteorites that have fallen in Bavaria. Among them is actually included a find which, due to the present territorial circumstances, no longer belongs to Bavaria but to Austria, namely that of Mauerkirchen. Because the municipality belonged to Bavaria at the time of the fall, it should at least seem warranted to a certain extent to list this stone here among the Bavarian ones.

These five stone meteorites are:

1) The stone from Mauerkirchen, now in the Austrian Innviertel, from the fall on November 20, 1768, at four hours past midday.

2) The stone from Eichstädt, which fell five kilometers from the town in the so-called Wittmes [forest] on February 19, 1785 at twelve o'clock midday.

3) The stone from Massing near Altötting in southern Bavaria from the fall on December 13, 1803 between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.

4) The stone from Schönenberg next to Burgau and Swabia, which fell on December 25, 1846 at two o'clock in the afternoon and
 
5) The stone from Krähenberg by Homburg in the Rhenish Pfalz from the fall on May 5, 1869 at six thirty in the evening.

I first came upon information of a sixth meteoritic rock in [Ludwig Wilhelm] Gilbert's _Annals of Physics_, 15th volume page 317, where it is cited that Gaspar Schott's _Physica curiosa_, 11th volume 19th chapter, reports: "here in our city of Herbipolis [Würzburg] is preserved in the temple of St. Jacobi across the bastion, in the monastery of the Scots,* chained to the temple column... it is hard and with an iron nature." Hence, it works out that it was presumably an iron meteorite. I put forward my inquiries about vestiges of this rock to the gentleman Professor Sandberger in Würzburg, who was nice enough to perform the most thorough search. The rock is missing. Owing to Sandberger's gracious communication, further information is given by Schnurrer in his _History of Epidemics_, volume two: "In the year 1103 (or 1104) a meteoritic rock fell in Würzburg, so big that four men were hardly able to carry the fourth part of it."

*) The Scotch Monasteries were established in 1140, 1803 saeculo 1819 part of the church was restored for worship, the choir in fact, the rest served as a military depot. The complete description and history of Wieland is in the archive of the _Historical Association of Lower Franconia and Aschaffenburg_ Vol. 16.

#### The Meteoritic Stone from Mauerkirchen

([Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-1.png) in the accompanying table)

A short booklet initially told about this fall: "News and Reports on some Rocks Dropped out of the Air on November 20, 1768 in Bavaria not far from Mauerkirchen" (Straubingen 1769). Referring to the same, Chladni shares in his chronological list of stone and iron masses which have fallen down with a firey meteor (Gilbert's _Annals of Physics_, 1803. Vol. 15. p. 316) that sundry ordinary folk near Mauerkirchen, who swore to it when questioned, stated that in the evening on the aforementioned day after four o'clock the skies noticeably darkened against the west and they heard an extraordinary roar and powerful bang in the air like thunder and with shooting fragments. Beneath this aerial turmoil a rock had fallen out of the air and, according to an authoritative visual inspection, made a pit in the ground two and a half schuh* deep. The stone doesn't even hold up to be a schuh in length, is six zoll wide, and weighs 38 bavarian pounds. It is made of matter so soft that one can crush it with the fingers, the color bluish mixed with some white flows or streamers, and also coated by a black crust.

*) 1 schuh = 29.75 centimeters, 1 zoll is around 2.62 centimeters, 12 linie = 1 zoll

Professor Imhof supplemented this account (_Bavarian Electoral Palatinate. Weekly Paper_. 1804. Section 4) with the following particulars: "The fallen rock was located the day after hearing the noise, on the so-called Schinperpoint in an oblique hole going inward two and a half schuh deep." Imhof identified the specific weight as 3.452 and described the grayish black, one-quarter linie [line (unit)] thick crust as giving sparks on steel, furthermore as constituent components:

1) reguline iron, which has fused with much of the exterior crust in little kernels and tines, is very pliable and viscous and makes a white, thick shiny filing streak,

2) pyrites,

3) small, flattened, angular grains, which are distinguished by their dark gray color, shell-like breaks, glistening appearance, and greater hardness,

4) still other tiny kernels of a white and yellow color that are translucent and shimmering. According to his analysis, the meteoritic stone is comprised of:

Silicon dioxide 25.40  
Iron oxide 40.24  
Iron 2.33  
Nickel 1.20  
Magnesium oxide 28.75  
Sulphur and losses 2.08  

(Compare with Otto Büchner's _Meteorites in Collections_ 1863 p. 9.)

Closer examination of the stone further revealed to me that the matt black, slightly glossy in spots, 0.7 — 0.3 mm. thick crust, like with other meteoritic stones, is merely fusion crust, which merges against the inner main mass without a sharp boundary because this is strenthened by the tiny iron pieces that border it, where sure enough faint amber granules are located and appear more glossy in the latter spots. Frequently the same small mineral pieces are melted and embedded in the crust or protrude into it. The main mass of the stone is colored light gray, dotted black due to the interspersed meteoritic iron, and, at many of these black spots, stained a rust color due to the effects of iron oxidation. The stone may easily be crushed between the fingers and has the impression of a trachytic tuff.

Out of the utterly fine, crumbly, almost dust-like matrix there arise quite a number of interspersed, roundish, poppy seed to millet sized granules, which are usually somewhat dark black or yellowish in color, matt on the exterior, and shiny like glass without cleavage surfaces when shattered, that have the character of chondrules and therefore imprint upon this stone the seal of the chondrites. Beneath the microscope these granules display a distinct quality. Some are very finely parallely striated, such that predominantly opaque, wide strips alternate with narrow, small transparent or translucent ones, as if transversely organized. In polarized light the latter show up with finely dappled matt colors. (_y_ in the illustration from the accompanying table, [Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-1.png)). Other granules are whitish, as if composed of the finest flour, opaque, but a little translucent around the edges, occasionally with the finest, slightly glimmering, separate, irregularly interspersed little needles (_x_ in the illustration).  Additionally, other granules have a type of radial fiber, though not clearly shown here. The smallest, rounded bits are water-clear and show up in polarized light as brilliant motley colors.

Aside from the chondrules embedded in the powdery main mass, there are more numerous, usually short, angular, elongated little slivers of a whitened mineral, which are noticeably reflective at the cleavage surface and in places vaguely parallely striated, and more roundish, angular, unevenly cracked, seldomly parallely striped granules that are distinguished by a yellowish or brownish color tone and a glass-like luster. To these are added metallically glistening, relatively small, botryoidal, angular clumps of meteoritic iron, in addition to the uncommon brassy yellow ferrous sulfide and the deep black, not metallically glistening, small chromite rods. On the worn off parts of the stone the harder granules stick out and allow the character of the chondrites to be clearly perceived, more so than with the transverse breaks, in which one notices the spherical deposits only with greater attention. The finest dust particles, which have to be considered as the agglutinating material resulting from the progressive granulation of the larger slivers, are partly water-clear, partly opaque, translucent, and turn out to be even in the smallest detail little birefringent crystalline shards, although in polarized light the multicolored shades are matt. There is not a trace of a glass-like intermediate mass to be found.

After treating the finely crushed (not pulverized) material with saltpeter hydrochloric acid and potash solution — apart from the metallic constituent parts — the yellowish little slivers (olivine) have disappeared and the remains are only of white and brownish scraps, which can be easily distinguished under the microscope. The brownish fragments are heavily fissured, seldomly furnished with traces of tiny, dim parallel striations, transparent, and in polarized light colored vibrantly with motley colors. They are undoubtedly little pieces of a mineral from the augite group. The white little slivers, in contrast, are in many cases only translucent, partly corroded by the acids, and in polarized light speckled with matt color tones, which here and there remind one of a striped design. The chemical analysis of the portion leftover following the action of the acids is also evidence that these little slivers have to be interpreted as feldspar-like constituent parts. The tiniest black particles are to be regarded as chromite. Thus, the stone consists of olivine, a feldspar-like augitic mineral, and meteoritic sulphur and chromite.

So that the chemical analysis was correct as well, the gentleman assistant Adolf Schwager was separately supervising examinations conducted at the same time. The measurement of the meteoritic and ferrous sulfide was done through individual experiments.* The analyses yielded:

*) Anything extractable was taken out of the crushed powder with the magnet and these component parts containing meteoritic iron were specially analyzed with the application of copper vitriol and copper chloride.

Compounds: | Bulk analysis, 65.45% portion decomposable in hydrochloric acid | 34.55% remainder elemental parts

Silicon dioxide | 38.14 | 23.23 | 61.39  
Aluminum oxide | 2.51 | 1.20 | 5.00  
Iron(II) oxide | 25.70 | 32.72 | 17.59  
Iron & Nickel | 6.30 | 9.65 | -. -  
Sulfur | 2.09 | 3.20 | -. -  
Phosphorus | 0.14 | 0.22 | -. -  
Chromium(II) oxide | 0.39 | -. - | 0.84  
Calcium oxide | 2.27 | 1.51 | 4.35  
Magnesium oxide | 21.73 | 29.13 | 7.70

Natron | 1.00 | Traces | 2.91  
Sum | 100.75 | 100.86 | 101.18  

It therefore logically follows that the stone meteorite of Mauerkirchen tops the list of silica impoverished chondrites, like those of Seres, Buschhof, Ensisheim, and Château-Renard. The contents can be calculated thereof, namely:

Meteoritic iron 2.81%  
Iron(II) sulfide 5.72  
Chromite 0.75  
Silicates 90.72  

As far as the interpretation of the silicates is concerned, we have to first envisage the essential elements decomposable in hydrochloric acid. The relatively low content of silicon dioxide here is especially striking. Nonetheless, a similar ratio repeats itself several times, for instance in the cases of the meteoritic stones of Seres, Tjabé (Java — September 19, 1869), Khetri (India), and others. Removing the meteoritic iron and iron(II) sulfide content, we obtain for component elements:

SiO₂ 26.45  
Al₂O₃ 1.35  
FeO 37.30  
CaO 1.70  
MgO 33.20  

wherein, if the aluminum oxide and calcium oxide are counted towards a decomposed feldspar, as is likely, and a fraction of the iron(II) oxide subtracted as still originating from meteoritic iron, then the constituent elements decomposed by acids may not be interpreted in any way except as good and proper olivine. That a portion of the iron is oxidized, and thereby appears to slightly increase the content of alkalis, is already indicated by the rust patches, which are present in the mass and sometimes quite widespread.

As far as this or the silicates of the leftover components are concerned, the relatively high silica and aluminum oxide content, in addition to that of the alkalis, arguably gives room to the presumption that, besides an augite mineral, there is also still a feldspar one present. At the same time though, even with this conjecture, there still remains a large excess of silica, which one cannot assume develops in the form of a precipitated quartz mineral, because on examination of thin sections in reflected light there is no trace of an admixture with anything usually recognizable due to the intense sparkle that can be observed in quartz. This behavior is only provisionally unexplained.

The same meteoritic stone has recently been subjected to a chemical analysis from another aspect. [Carl] Rammelsberg uses (_The Chemical Nature of the Meteorites_, papers of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, for 1870 p. 148 and following) as the result of the investigation performed by [Frank] Crook*: Composition:

*) _On the Chemical Constitution of the [Ensisheim, Mauerkirchen, Shergotty, and Muddoor] Meteoric Stones_. Göttingen Dissertation. (Not available to me).

3.52% Meteoritic iron  
1.92% Iron(II) sulfide  
0.72% Chromium iron  
92.68% Silicates  
100.00 in fact:  
the silicates are present as:

Substance: | Bulk analysis as a whole | in which 61% is decomposable by acids. Fraction. | in which 39% is undecomposable in acids. Fraction.  
Silicon dioxide | 44.81 | 32.68 | 3.94  
Aluminum oxide | 1.24 | 9.36 | 4.17  
Iron(II) oxide | 24.55 | 28.91 | 17.71  
Magnesium oxide | 26.10 | 37.44 | 8.20  
Calcium oxide | 2.28 | 0.61 | 4.91  
Natron | 0.26 | - | 0.67  
Potash | 0.16 | - | 0.40  

These results deviate so considerably from those communicated earlier, that for this no other grounds can be found except for the wide inequality in the composition of the meteoritic stones, which all the more expresses the greater level of importance of the findings of this examination, with one being obliged to work with ever smaller quantities. The microscopic examination of the thin sections directly supported this supposition, by allowing the broadest inconsistency in the manner of distribution of the constituent pieces to be perceived. A larger grain of this or that consitutent member mixed into the expended sample, in the case of low quantities, affects the numbers in a sizable way. For instance, jagged little nodules of meteoritic iron pieces can be dislocated from the mass, whose magnitude has no relation, in general and as a whole, to the low percentage content of meteoritic iron in the stone. The interspersed, hard nodules and granules behave similarly.

The description referring to the composition of those constituent components decomposable in hydrochloric acid is particularly dissimilar. Yet, even in Crook's analysis the relatively low amount of silica comes out very clearly. The results of the analysis of the parts left undecomposed in hydrochloric acid prove to be less divergent. Precisely this proves that it does not lie in the course of the analytical work, as it might seem if the silica content here was likewise comparatively high, such as was detected in the portion decomposable in acids. Because this remaining part, as the microscopic examination of it shows, is comprised of dissimilar mineral substances, namely a white and a brown component part, the oxygen ratio taken as a whole is not able to provide us any special information.

The thin sections, which are challenging to produce because of the effortless friability of the mass and which can only be obtained in a suitable condition by repetitive soaking with very dilute Canada balsam, provide, as the thin section image in [Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-1.png) of the accompanying table demonstrates, some instructive insights concerning the composition of the stones and the distribution of the constituent elements. Above all, the chondrules stick out with their partly powdery, friable, and in part fibrous composition. Despite their poor transparency they invariably turn out to be colorful, viewed in polarized light, and indeed, not just their bright little stripes, but their entire mass. Compared with these intermixtures, the remaining distinct tiny fragments are always irregularly defined, yellowish, brownish, and whitish. They are all crossed by uncountable bites, which only here and there run parallely. Minor little pieces and dust particles of the seemingly same minerals constitute the matrix in which the larger debris lay interspersed. In polarized light, color phenomena materialize down to the finest particles, so that the absence of a vitreous binding agent can be definitely noticed in the thin sections as well. Worthy of remark are countless tiny, round, water-clear granules that are the admixed matrix. Meteoritic iron and ferrous sulfide nodules approximately share the dimensions of the small mineral fragments, though their outlines do not generate the impression of destruction like the latter, and are located quite uniformly dispersed in the mass. We see therefore that the meteoritic stone from Mauerkirchen has a structure that is not substantially different from other chondritic meteoritic stones.

#### The Meteoritic Stone from Eichstädt

([Figure 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-2.png) in the accompanying table)

Concerning the fall of these stones, it was told that in the so-called Wittmes, a wooded area about five kilometers to the west of Eichstädt [Eichstätt], on February 19, 1785 in the afternoon between twelve and one o'clock, a laborer at a brick mill saw, after a thunder-like roar, a great black rock fall onto ground covered with snow on which bricks were lying around. When he went to the spot, he found the stone, which had shattered a brick, one hand deep in the ground and so hot that he at first had to cool it down with snow so that he could take hold of it. The stone was approximately a foot in diameter and, parenthetically, weighed three kilograms. Schafhäutl (academic notice in the Academy of Sciences in Munich, 1847 p. 559.) describes the same as follows: "Its structure is considerably coarse-grained, the grains being more roundish than is the case in all those remaining aerolites; indeed, even completely elliptical, polished looking granules of a grayish color are found, with compact, kind of matt, flat breaks in them, devoid of perceivable crystalline texture. Alongside these are situated greenish, olivine-like grains with glassy, conchoidal breaks. Ferrous sulfide, nickel iron, and magnetite are dissiminated among these grains, so that of all the meteoritic stones in our collection (Munich's State Collection), it has the strongest effect on the magnetic needle."

The specific weight* is given:

from Schreibers as 3.700  
from Rumler as 3.599  

*) Vergl. Moll's Annal, d. Berg- u. Hüttenk. Vol. 3. p. 251.

Klaproth has analyzed this stone and gives (Gilberts Ann. 13. 338) as its component parts:

Solid iron 19.00  
Nickel metal 1.50  
Brown iron oxide 16.50  
Magnesium oxide 21.50  
Silicas 37.00  
Loss (with sulfur) 4.50  

The piece stored in the Munich State Collection shows a black, matt-glossed, rugose crust, and a whitish gray, coarse-grained chondritic, easily broken main mass, dotted yellowish here and there by numerous rust stains, and from which huge chondrules can often easily be disengaged. They are found up to about 3 mm. wide in diameter, they are very hard, at the surface matt, knobbed like strawberries and grubbed in such a manner that the connected little mineral fragments of the main mass appear as if cemented to the surface. Moreover, one notices small reflective stripes in many places, whereby it appears faceted, so to speak. Tightly intergrown little meteoritic iron bits also occur, which are sometimes sunk into the surface. A smoothing of the surface never presents itself, as deposits must, if the globules were caused by abrasion and tumbling. They rather resemble, according to their external texture, the pig iron stone pellets that are found in slags. If one shatters them, then they reveal a flat conchoidal surface break, a matt glassy luster, a blackish grey color and with further fragmentation, they prove themselves under the microscope to be not a homogeneous, but a composite mass. One can clearly discern a clear glass pervaded with numerous small vesicles, in polarized light exceptional motley colored constituent parts alongside merely translucent cloudy ones, as though composed of the tiniest dust particles, but, in polarized light still clearly colored, the main body is at times finely striped and distinctly a translucent intense yellowish-brown, distingusihed in polarized light by unaffected tinted small stripes. In thin sections one sees their structure even more clearly, although here they are situated in a dark colored main mass and obtaining good transparency is challenging. Due to the occurrence of quite a lot of mixed pieces of meteoritic iron that are in large part already slightly corroded and surrounded by a small ring of yellowish brown color, the clarity of those little mineral pieces, which otherwise stand out by their transparency, also suffer. The yellow color is due to the ferric oxyhydroxide, which was formed by the exposure of the meteoritic iron to the humid air of our atmosphere, primarily retroactive throughout the time that the stone has lain on the Earth or in our collections. This ferric oxyhydroxide penetrates into the finest little rifts and seams or any spaces in between, but can easily be removed by acids. Apart from the meteoritic iron there are added little mineral chips, irregularly scattered and seldomly containing parallel lines, of the aggregate material that comprises the meteoritic stone. Sometimes there are water-clear, slightly cracked little remains, sometimes striated with a system of straight parallel lines or are traversed by jagged rips at oblique downward angles, something like it is found preserved in augite, or else by a cell network similar to certain moss lamella, a curiously elongated and transversly divided mesh structure (_d_) stands out. Occasionally in a piece of the debris a number of systems of such little parallel strips bump together. In between these larger fragments lie smaller ones entirely of the same character as the greater aggregate. In polarized light all the small parts, which in general are merely transparent, show up in variegated colors, inside which are distributed individual aggregate-like slivers, and occasionally run parallel, striped or belt-like. Ultimately, the spheroidal inclusions already alluded to turn out to be exceptionally common components. Of the the manifold forms they possess, we emphasize merely a few that are commonly found. Considerably numerous are the chondrules with an eccentric, radially fibrous assemblage (_a_), which as a rule emanates from a more granular section located near the rim and in quite a few cases is detached, in a similar way mesh-like and cross-divided tufts of rays taper off. This structure agrees so well with those already described, which we come across on other regularly defined little fragments, that we have to consider the latter as the derivatives of broken, larger chondrules. Others of the latter are composed of different systems of darker little striations traversing at acute and obtuse angles (_b_), a structure that can be considered as the inception of a crystalline mode of periodic disrupted formation. In addition, other chondrules occur with a cloudy dust-like, slightly translucent substance, often in which very numerous, densely packed, lighter little strips (_c_) are noticeably dispersed groupwise following different angles. Finally, it is not uncommon for globules to occur, which seem sintered together, so to speak, from larger, lighter granules (_e_) separated from each other by dark little strips in between. From all of this, it is sufficiently clear that in the stone of Eichstädt we have in front of us a chondrite of the finest kind. It can really be held as the type of this kind of structure, which is well-known as being prevalent in the meteoritic stones.

As concerns its composition, the analysis (Assistant A. Schwager) has yielded that the stone is comprised of: 

22.98 meteoritic iron,  
3.82 iron(II) sulfide,  
32.44 decomposable in acids,  
40.76 minerals not decomposable in acids.

The composition is on the whole A, then  
B silicates decomposable in HCl  
C components not decomposable in HCl:  

| A. | B. | C.  
Silica | 33.31 | 34.45 | 55.53  
Aluminium oxide | 2.31 | 0.86 | 5.13  
Iron(II) oxide | 15.34 | 24.52 | 16.66  
Iron (with phosphorus) | 24.64 | - | -  
Nickel | 0.94 | - | -  
Calcium oxide | 0.74 | 0.68 | 1.13  
Sulfur | 1.42 | - | -  
Chromium oxide | 0.15 | - | 0.73  
Magnesium oxide | 18.86 | 37.31 | 19.34  
Potash | 0.40 | 0.68 | 0.56  
Natron | 1.04 | 1.31 | 1.62  
| 99.15 | 99.81 | 100.70

The content of the constituent parts decomposable by acids, excluding the olivine, indicates a feldspar. Though we have in it:

SiO₂ 34.45 with 18.37 oxygen  
Al₂O₃ 0.86 with 0.40  
FeO 24.52 with 5.45  
MgO 37.31 with 14.90  
CaO 0.68 with 0.19  
Ka₂O 0.68 with 0.11  
Na₂O 1.31 with 0.34  

Out of this one sees that if we precipitate a unisilicate the oxygen proportion is still not fully sufficient to completely satisfy the requirements, therefore the analysis does not transmit to us any information about the nature of the silicates still present, other than some more olivine.

Finally, in the rest of that not decomposed by acids, the ratios provide the following measure:

Silica 55.53 with 29.62 O = 22.6 + 7  
Iron(II) oxide 16.66 with 3.70 O = 3.58 + 0.12  
Magnesium oxide 19.34 with 7.73 O  
Chromium oxide 0.73 with 0.23 O  
Aluminium oxide 5.13 with 2.39 O = 2.33 + 0.06  
Calcium oxide 1.13 with 0.32 O  
Potash 0.56 with 0.10 O  
Natron 1.62 with 0.42 O  

Out of this is worked out a bisilicate, chromium iron (of the composition of L'Aigle), and an andesine-like feldspar in a proportion of approximately 79 : 1 : 21.

So, in total, the Eichstädt meteorite is roughly made of:

Meteoritic iron 22.98  
Iron(II) sulfide 3.82  
Chromium iron 0.40  
Olivine 31.00  
Mineral of the augite group 31.90  
Andesine-like feldspar 8.46  
Feldspar-like mineral 1.54  

The frequent occurrence and relative size of the chondrules led to a special analysis of these globules. In order to be sure that the processed material was free of the smallest adhering mineral pieces, the chondrules were rubbed back and forth on a dull sanding glass plate, until their surfaces were made completely smooth and shiny. Unfortunately, the amount at my disposal was only very small (0.12 gram) and as a result the analysis was not able to be made with greater accuracy. From preliminary studies it had already been ascertained that the substance of the chondrules separates into a decomposable and an indecomposable mass in hydrochloric acid. The former additionally includes ferrous sulfide, which, as the examination in thin sections teaches, is found as tiny granules tightly grown together and, so to speak, sunk into the globules.

I found the composition as:

Iron(II) sulfide 1.53  
1\. Decomposable in hydrochloric acid 53.05  
2\. Indecomposable in hydrochloric acid 45.42  

The composition of the silicates of 1 and 2 was also found  

| 1 | 2  
Silica | 26.26 with 14.22 O | 53.21 with 28.38 O  
Iron(II) oxide | 30.09 with 6.67 O | 14.86 with 3.30 O  
Magnesium oxide | 31.53 with 12.60 O | 26.42 with 10.56 O  
Aluminium oxide | 2.70 with 1.26 O | - -  
Calcium oxide | 1.00 with 0.29 O | 3.67 with 1.05 O  
Alkalis | 8.00 with 1.70 O | - -  
| 99.98 | 98.16  

To begin with, it is noteworthy that, as has already been noted on another page, the composition of the chondrules is almost the same as that of the whole mass, and can themselves be dissolved into two similar portions through treatment with acids. 

The part dissolvable in hydrochloric acid, except for some residual content of meteoritic iron and ferrous sulfide, concurs closely with olivine. Though here too, as in numerous cases of analyzed chondrites, there is a lack of silica. I would like to assume that this originates from a surplus of ferrous oxide, which, instead of decomposed olivine, stems from finely admixed meteoritic iron. Aluminum oxide, calcium oxide, and alkalis point to an admixture of small feldspar-like parts, as with the main mass of the chondrite. Yet, offering an interpretation of these components presents complications, which up till now are still not resolved.

The remaining part, undecomposed in hydrochloric acid, fits much better with the measure of a bisilicate; even if a little bit of the silica is missing here, it can be considered a consequence of losses during the analysis itself, likely due to the low amount utilized in the analysis.

#### The Meteoritic Stone from Massing

([Figure 3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/Gumbel/Bayern/Fig-3.png) in the accompanying table)

About the nearby circumstances of the fall of these meteorites, Prof. Imhof (Bavarian Electoral Palatinate. Weekly Paper 1804 p. 3 and following) shares:

*) Gilberts Ann. of Phys. 18. 330.

"According to the administrative reports of the electoral provincial office, many of the country folk, who lived around the market town of Mässing (Massing) in the district of Eggenfelden, heard a bang like cannon fire, nine to ten times, on December 13, 1803 in the morning between ten and eleven o'clock. A farmer at St. Nicholas, who came out of his farmhouse during this noise and looked up high, glimpsed something that went by very high with a constant buzz in the air and eventually fell onto the rooftop of his wagonhut, shattering a number of shingles and penetrating it. He walked up to the hut and found in it a completely black stone that smelled like powder and was as hot as a stone lying in an oven. He said he heard the so-called shooting from Alten-Oetting [Altötting] (i.e. from the [south] east), but the stone had come up over Heiligenstadt [Gangkofen] (i.e. from the [north] west). The stone weighed over 1 1/2 kilograms, has a specific weight of 3.365, a dark black, slightly thicker crust than the one from Mauerkirchen, and is a lot more coarsely grained in the breaks."

According to Imhof, as component parts it contains:

1\. reguline iron, which shows up as thin iron filings visibly ingrown and shiny,

2\. pyrites, which beneath the magnifying lens appear crystallized and leave a black powder when rubbed,

3\. larger and smaller flattened, angular masses, some of a dark brown, others of a darker color, which differ from those due to their shimmery quality and greater hardness,

4\. here and there one detects cubic granules and translucent flakes of a yellowish color and with a glassy luster, looking like quartz, though not possessing the hardness of quartz,

5\. also white grains of an erratic form are sprinkled, some of which are over three linie thick,

6\. under the microscope one additionally spots an off-white, blending into yellow, metal that obeys the magnet and is probably metallic nickel.

According to the analysis of this researcher, the stone, divided into 100 fractions, is made of:

Reguline iron 1.80  
Reguline nickel 1.35  
Brown iron(II) oxide 32.54  
Magnesia 23.25  
Silicas 31.00  
Losses in sulfur and nickel 10.06  

Ammler gives (O. Büchner _ibid_. p. 17) the specific weight as 3.3636.

Prof. von Schafhäutl describes (_ibid_. p. 558) this stone, "with the appearance of pumice porphyry, in which the constituent silicates occur in such large aggregates, that one is able to easily discern them with the naked eye. The stone is comprised of milky white grains with sheet-like radial structures, of granular olivine-like pea-sized masses, and partly of dull, basalt-like fragments, which, however, from time to time show up with augite-like cleavage planes, even shiny like glass. Scattered, cracked, iridescent ferrous sulfide and granules of chromium iron are found sparingly. The stone does not have an effect on the magnetic needle. With the Lötrohr it quite easily melts and is covered with a glassy, shiny glaze, like the aerolite from Stannern."

According to my observations, the stone has a brownish black crust, shiny like glass, and its grayish white, easily friable mass is comprised of:

1\. yellowish green to light green, somewhat parallely cracked, considerably large 1 — 1 1/2 mm. wide in diameter, rounded and irregular granules (as in crystalline form) that occur only sporadically as seemingly admixed pieces, which are easily disintegrated by acids and must be held as olivine.

2\. of a white mineral, often transparent like glass or merely translucent like a dusty cloud, heavily cracked, seldomly with parallel stripes, furnished at times with clear cleavage surfaces that in polarized light come across as vivid single- or multi-colored patches, and that is also disintegrated by acids, in accordance with a feldspar.

3\. of a wine yellow to greyish green, or faintly reddish brown, glass-like matte polished mineral, 1.5 to 2 mm. large, colored vividly in polarized light, through not dichroic, some longitudinal fibers (but unclear, striated) and suffused with abundant small bubbles. These component parts are not decomposed by acids and belong to the augite group.

4\. of black, intensely shiny chromium iron, not decomposable in acids, that yielded a magnificent green glass in the phosphate test.

5\. finally, of dark, metallic granules, to some extent pulled by the magnet, which are in most cases related to ferrous sulfide, or at least meteoritic iron.

All of these larger, prevalently roundish, irregularly cornered (not longish spear-shaped) small pieces are situated in a fine particulate-like, granular, gray matrix, which seems to be comprised of the same little and tiny slivers as was just mentioned. Here too, a glass-like binding mass is not detected.

The analysis of A. Schwager's yielded:

Substance: | Bulk Analysis | 21.33% decomposable in hydrochloric acid | 78.67% not decomposable in hydrochloric acid  
Silica | 52.115 | 39.59 | 56.71  
Aluminium oxide | 8.204 | 29.51 | 2.54  
Iron(II) oxide | 19.138 | 2.83 | 23.46  
Iron | 0.523 | 2.49 | -  
Nickel | Traces | Traces | -  
Chromium oxide | 0.979 | - | 1.24  
Calcium oxide | 5.786 | 15.70 | 3.15  
Magnesium oxide | 8,485 | 3.33 | 10.74  
Potash | 1.188 | 4.78 | 0.85  
Natron | 1.928 | 4.78 | 1.17  
Sulfur | 0.374 | 1.78 | -  
| 99.720 | 100.06 | 99.86

The 21.33% fraction that can be decomposed by hydrochloric acid can be calculated, according to the observed content of sulfur, magnesium oxide, and aluminium oxide, as approximately consisting of:

10% Olivine (hyalosiderite)  
86% Anorthite with high alkali content  
4% Iron(II) sulfide and meteoritic iron  

In rounded numbers, feldspar A and olivine B would be comprised of:

| A | B  
Silica | 42 | 37.25  
Aluminium oxide | 34 | -  
Iron(II) oxide | - | 29.75  
Calcium oxide | 18 | -  
Magnesium oxide | - | 33.00  
Alkalis | 6 | -

As concerns the remaining 78.67% fraction, not decomposable by acids, one must even here presume a small percentage of feldspar in addition to chromium iron and augite, on the order of:

2.5% Chromium iron  
13.5% Feldspar-like substance (A)  
84.0% Augite mineral (B).

Both of the latter (A and B) have come up with a composition as follows:

| A | B  
Silica | 66 | 86  
Aluminium oxide | 19 | -  
Iron(II) oxide | - | 36  
Calcium oxide | - | 4  
Magnesium oxide | - | 14  
Alkalis | 15 | -  

Furthermore, considering that the ratio decomposable and not decomposable in hydrochloric acid is 21.33 to 78.67, one is able, in accordance with the above mentioned interpretation, to roughly imagine a composition made of: 

Olivine 2.00  
Iron(II) sulfide 0.75  
Meteoritic iron 0.25  
Chromium iron 2.00  
Anorthite 18.00  
2nd feldspathic substance 11.00  
Augite mineral 66.00  

Up till now the stone of Massing has been placed on the side of Luotolax and Rammelsberg (_The Chemical Nature of the Meteorites_ p. 136) counts it with the Howardites (olivine-augite-anorthite meteoritic stones).

I think that it has more correspondence with the augite group of the eucrites because the olivine is very sparse in extant.

We first want to see how this understanding of the optical examination of the thin sections, as shown in Figure 3, fits with such a view. Initially one notices large, irregularly cornered granules — not like the rounded ones typical of the chondrites, and a considerably uniform, fine main mass with distinct brightly shining, metallic, steel-grey and brass-yellow accumulated veins. At first ignoring the large, irregular, abnormal additions so to speak, we come to especially large groups in the matrix of a greenish-yellow, next a faint wine yellow, then a pale reddish-brown and white minerals, which we are justified to view as the main admixed components. The sparse greenish-yellow little pieces (_a_) are irregularly cracked, glisten with the most vivid aggregate colors in polarized light, and become decomposed by acids — olivine. At first glance one would like to consider the amply abundant accumulated veins of the faint wine yellow, very parallely cracked mineral (_b_) for olivine. But they appear undecomposed with the treatment of boiling acids and therefore are not able to belong to olivine. One also notices a kind of parallel striping that does not correspond to that of olivine, but reminds one of enstatite. Additionally, there are situated numerous, often just translucent, yet also quite transparent, non-dichroic little pieces (_c_), colored reddish-brown at the rim that seem to have all the behaviors of augite. I therefore think that I ought to suppose that two minerals of the augite group are represented here, namely enstatite and augite. The little glass-clear or dust-like white pieces (_d_) are partly decomposable by acids, but partly they turn up as more or less unaffected in the powder treated with acids. This likewise points to the presence of two different feldspars, traces of parallel striations can be discerned in one with thin sections in polarized light. Admixed meteoritic iron, even if sparse — contrary to Schafhäutl's information — is also genuine (_e_), since in thin sections I had detected the occurence of two distinct granules on whose glossy steel-grey surfaces I applied copper vitriol solution, whereby one could immediately observe the excretion of metallic copper.

The nature of the large inclusions is challenging to explain, labels _x_ and _y_ point to them in the thin section. The larger, _x_ is parallely streaked and cross-cracked, dark olive green to reddish-brown, a little transparent, and colorful in polarized light. It should be considered as a slightly modified augite fragment. The second fragment, _y_ is yellowish, very fine grained, quite dense, weakly translucent and spread throughout with the finest dust particles. It most closely resembles the shards of a chondrite granule. Inclusions like these and others of very diverse qualities of structure are still embedded in the matrix. Although a clearly chondritic structure is not present, these inclusions and the minerals of the matrix behave so similarly to the integral parts of the chondrites that the meteoritic stone from Massing must be attributed with a completely analogous formation to the latter.

The considerable content of chromium iron in these stones gives reason to investigate its composition in greater detail, because, as far as I know, the chromium iron of the meteoritic stone has not been isolated as a subject of analysis up till now. For this purpose, the chromium iron in the meteoritic stone of L'Aigle seemed better suited, as larger granules occur in it.
