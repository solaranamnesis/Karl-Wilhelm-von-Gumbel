#### "About the stone meteorites found in Bavaria."

Among the stone meteorites that have fallen and been located in Bavarian areas, there are quite a few whose chemical composition is known to us only from antiquated analyses, while still no chemical investigation has been undertaken on any of them up till the present moment. Moreover, since many of them lack an exhaustive survey, such as has been recently performed on types of stone by means of a thin section and microscope, it thus seemed to me sufficiently interesting to carry out such work and compile the results with the earlier findings. Through the special kindness of professor Dr. [Wolfgang Franz] von Kobell, the gentleman curator of the mineralogical state collection, I obtained the material needed for this purpose and I gladly use this opportunity to express my best thanks for his friendly assistance in my investigation. Several broad remarks, which are included in the conclusions, are sourced from other meteoritic stones that I have from time to time pulled into the circle of my study for comparison.

It turns out that there are just five known stone meteorites which have fallen in Bavaria. Among them is actually included a find which, due to the present territorial circumstances, no longer belongs to Bavaria but to Austria, namely that of Mauerkirchen. Because the municipality belonged to Bavaria at the time of the fall, it should at least seem warranted to a certain extent to list this stone here among the Bavarian ones.

These five stone meteorites are:

1) The stone from Mauerkirchen, now in the Austrian Innviertel, from the fall on November 20, 1768, at four hours past midday.

2) The stone from Eichstädt, which fell five kilometers from the town in the so-called Wittmes [forest] on February 19, 1785 at twelve o'clock midday.

3) The stone from Massing near Altötting in southern Bavaria from the fall on December 13, 1803 between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.

4) The stone from Schönenberg next to Burgau and Swabia, fallen on December 25, 1846 at two o'clock in the afternoon and
 
5) The stone from Krähenberg by Homburg in the Rhenish Pfalz from the fall on May 5, 1869 at six thirty in the evening.

I first came upon information of a sixth meteoritic stone in [Ludwig Wilhelm] Gilbert's _Annals of Physics_, 15th volume page 317, where it is cited that Gaspar Schott's _Physica curiosa_, 11th volume 19th chapter, reports: "here in our city of Herbipolis [Würzburg] is preserved in the temple of St. Jacobi across the bastion, in the monastery of the Scots,* chained to the temple column... it is hard and with an iron nature." Hence, it works out that it was presumably an iron meteorite. I put forward my inquiries about vestiges of this stone to the gentleman Professor Sandberger in Würzburg, who was nice enough to perform the most thorough search. The stone is missing. Owing to Sandberger's gracious communication, further information is given by Schnurrer in his _History of Epidemics_, volume two: "In the year 1103 (or 1104) a meteoritic stone fell in Würzburg, so big that four men were hardly able to carry the fourth part of it."

*) The Scotch Monasteries were established in 1140, 1803 saeculo 1819 part of the church was restored for worship, the choir in fact, the rest served as a military depot. The complete description and history of Wieland is in the archive of the _Historical Association of Lower Franconia and Aschaffenburg_ Vol. 16.
