#### "About the stone meteorites found in Bavaria."

Among the stone meteorites that have fallen and been located in Bavarian areas, there are quite a few whose chemical composition is known to us only from antiquated analyses, while still no chemical investigation has been undertaken on any of them up till the present moment. Moreover, since many of them lack an exhaustive survey, such as has been recently performed on types of stone by means of a thin section and microscope, it thus seemed to me sufficiently interesting to carry out such work and compile the results with the earlier findings. Through the special kindness of professor Dr. [Wolfgang Franz] von Kobell, the gentleman curator of the mineralogical state collection, I obtained the material needed for this purpose and I gladly use this opportunity to express my best thanks for his friendly assistance in my investigation. Several broad remarks, which are included in the conclusions, are sourced from other meteoritic stones that I have from time to time pulled into the circle of my study for comparison.

It turns out that there are just five known stone meteorites which have fallen in Bavaria. Among them is actually included a find which, due to the present territorial circumstances, no longer belongs to Bavaria but to Austria, namely that of Mauerkirchen. Because the municipality belonged to Bavaria at the time of the fall, it should at least seem warranted to a certain extent to list this stone here among the Bavarian ones.

These five stone meteorites are:

1) The stone from Mauerkirchen, now in the Austrian Innviertel, from the fall on November 20, 1768, at four hours past midday.

2) The stone from Eichstädt, which fell five kilometers from the town in the so-called Wittmes [forest] on February 19, 1785 at twelve o'clock midday.

3) The stone from Massing near Altötting in southern Bavaria from the fall on December 13, 1803 between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.

4) The stone from Schönenberg next to Burgau and Swabia, fallen on December 25, 1846 at two o'clock in the afternoon and
 
5) The stone from Krähenberg by Homburg in the Rhenish Pfalz from the fall on May 5, 1869 at six thirty in the evening.
