#### "On the of Nature of the Stone Meteorites from the Fall of February 12, 1875 in Iowa County North America"

There took place, according to information from John Lawrence Smith,* on February 12th of this year, in Iowa County of North America in the evening around ten-thirty under a slightly cloudy sky, a powerful bang* from a meteor fall visible for miles around, which delivered a large number of stones. Smith reported that by then approximately 150 kilograms of stones had been collected, of which 25 kilograms belonged to Prof. Hinrichs. The academy is in debt to his charitableness, for he gave away a splendid part weighing approximately 1,500 grams, which gave rise to the following description on the nature of this highly peculiar meteorite.

The Iowa [Homestead] meteorite belongs to that most commonly occurring class of stones, which one refers to by the name of chondrites, or according to [Gabriel Auguste] Daubrée, in the domain of the sporadosiderite and in the group of the oligosiderite, as Prof. Hinrichs had correctly noted* in his accompanying letter to the Paris Academy, which included a portion of all these meteorites, and corroborated by Daubrée himself.

The considerably sharp-edged, acute-angled, unevenly tetrahedral stone is coated all around with a black fusion crust, and in the inside light grayish white, furnished with abundant small black nodules and granules of meteoritic and sulphuric iron and seemingly scattered small rust stains. The stone is rather hard and cannot be crushed with the hand.
