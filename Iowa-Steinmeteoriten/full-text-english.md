#### "On the of Nature of the Stone Meteorites from the Fall of February 12, 1875 in Iowa County North America"

Smith reported that by then approximately 150 kilograms of stones had been collected, of which 25 kilograms belonged to Prof. Hinrichs. The academy is in debt to his charitableness, for he gave away a splendid part weighing approximately 1,500 grams, which gave rise to the following description on the nature of this highly peculiar meteorite.
